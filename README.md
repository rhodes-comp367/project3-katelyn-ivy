# Final project

**Explain the general theme and specific features of your project.**
<br> Our project focuses on building the list type in agda. We are also building a sorted list type. 
With both types, we are additionally developing proofsz associated with a list. Some examples include reversing a list preserves size, concatening preserves the elements within the lists, and a merged list remains sorted after merging.


**Cite any resources or existing code you used.**
<br> We used a culmination of deepseek and mazzo.li but their specific uses are cited within the program.


**Discuss any challenges, or anything you'd like feedback on.**
<br> Ivy: Writting
