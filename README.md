# Final project

### **Explain the general theme and specific features of your project.** ###
<br> Our project focuses on building the list type in agda. We are also building a sorted list type. 
With both types, we are additionally developing proofs associated with a list. Some examples include reversing a list preserves size, concatening preserves the elements within the lists, and a merged list remains sorted after merging.


### **Cite any resources or existing code you used.** ###
<br> We used a culmination of deepseek and mazzo.li but their specific uses are cited within the program.


### **Discuss any challenges, or anything you'd like feedback on.** ###
<br> Below are 
<br> Ivy: Writing tests cases was particularly challenging for me. I couldn't quite figure out if the issue was with the code we had written or if the issue was with the test cases themselves. I don't necessarily need feedback but I did struggle with it. 

<br> Katelyn: Merging with a sorted lists was quite difficult. Getting the function to do recurssion properly and applying the logic of merge (especially to proofs) was difficult.
